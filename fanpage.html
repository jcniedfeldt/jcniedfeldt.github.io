        "The A

    <p>His second studio album, x (pronounced "multiply"), was released in June 2014. It peaked at number one in the UK
        and
        the US. In 2015, x won the Brit Award for Album of the Year, and he received the Ivor Novello Award for

    <p>Sheeran's third album, ÷ (pronounced "divide"), was released in March 2017. The album debuted at number one in

        by
        debuting in the top two positions of the charts. He also became the first artist to have two songs debut in the
        US top
        10 in the same week. By March 2017, Sheeran had accumulated ten top 10 singles from ÷ on the UK Singles Chart,
        breaking
        the record for most top 10 UK singles from one album. His fourth single from ÷, "Perfect", reached number one
